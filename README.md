    cd TrackInTrade
    

2.  *Install the required dependencies:*

## 🛡 Security

Security is a top priority for TrackInTrade.

* *Authentication: We use a **session-based login system* to ensure that user sessions are handled securely.
* *Data Isolation*: The backend logic is designed to ensure that a logged-in user can only ever access their own trade entries and notes.
* *No JWT*: For simplicity and robust control, we avoid JWTs. Each browser tab is treated as an individual session entity.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

We have an exciting roadmap ahead!

- [ ] *Chart Visualizations*: Integrate Plotly or Chart.js to display trade setups on charts.
- [ ] *Data Export*: Allow users to export their journal data to CSV or PDF formats.
- [ ] *Email Summaries*: Send automated weekly performance summary reports via email.
- [ ] *Automation*: Use Prefect or a cron job for scheduled tasks and data processing.
- [ ] *Mobile Alerts*: Implement real-time mobile notifications for trade events via Twilio.
