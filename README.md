* A [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech/) account for the PostgreSQL database.

### Installation

1.  *Clone the repository:*
    bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/TrackInTrade.git](https://github.com/yourusername/TrackInTrade.git)
    cd TrackInTrade
    

2.  *Install the required dependencies:*
    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

3.  *Set up Environment Variables:*
    * Create a new project on [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech/).
    * Find your database credentials (Host, DB Name, User, Password).
    * Create a .env file in the root directory and add your credentials.

    FLASK_SECRET_KEY="your_strong_secret_key"
    

4.  *Initialize the Database:*
    * You will need to run a script to create the necessary tables based on the schema above. Ensure your database.py contains a function to do this.

5.  *Start the Flask Server:*
    bash
    python web/app.py
    
    The application will be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

## üõ° Security

Security is a top priority for TrackInTrade.

* *Authentication: We use a **session-based login system* to ensure that user sessions are handled securely.
* *Data Isolation*: The backend logic is designed to ensure that a logged-in user can only ever access their own trade entries and notes.
* *No JWT*: For simplicity and robust control, we avoid JWTs. Each browser tab is treated as an individual session entity.

## üöß Future Improvements

We have an exciting roadmap ahead!

- [ ] *Chart Visualizations*: Integrate Plotly or Chart.js to display trade setups on charts.
- [ ] *Data Export*: Allow users to export their journal data to CSV or PDF formats.
- [ ] *Email Summaries*: Send automated weekly performance summary reports via email.
- [ ] *Automation*: Use Prefect or a cron job for scheduled tasks and data processing.
- [ ] *Mobile Alerts*: Implement real-time mobile notifications for trade events via Twilio.
